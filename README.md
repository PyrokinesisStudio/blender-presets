Presets for Blender

## Simple Keymap
A simplified keymap for inclusion in Blender as an alternative, or tentative new default.

This keymap holds a few principles as sancrosanct:
 1. Selection keys are consistent are across all editors.
 2. Default tool bindings are kept to a minimum, allowing maximum customization by the artist. Only the most essential tools for each editor are mapped.
 3. Navigation keys are consistent across all editors except where necessary, e.g. 2D VS. 3D navigation
 4. The keymap should work equally with Mice and Tablets
